    <h2><strong>Description</strong></h2>
    <p>Asparagus and eggs make the best spring breakfast or a beautiful light lunch.
        Asparagus is cooked in a pan with a little oil, and topped with two eggs.</p>
        
    <h2><strong>Ingredients</strong></h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 garlic clove, finely chopped</li>
        <li>8 thin-stemmed asparagus stalks, trimmed</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 pinch red pepper flakes (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2><strong>Steps</strong></h2>
    <p>1. Heat a small skillet over medium-high heat. Add olive oil and garlic; cook and stir until garlic is fragrant, about 30 seconds.</p>
    <p>2. Add asparagus and cook until fork-tender, turning asparagus often to ensure even cooking, about 4 minutes.</p>
    <p>3. Spread asparagus out and crack 2 eggs over the asparagus. Cover with lid and cook until egg whites are firm and yolk is done to desired consistency, about 4 minutes.</p>
    <p>4. Season with salt and pepper; sprinkle with red pepper flakes and serve immediately.</p>
